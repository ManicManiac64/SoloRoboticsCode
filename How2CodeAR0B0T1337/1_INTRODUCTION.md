# HI

This is the introduction to this guide. We don't really have a guide for coding, and with new freshmen (hopefully) joining the team next season, I figured it'd be incredibly important to teach them to code robots, so that they may teach me code when I grow senile. These guides assume you already have an understanding of syntax, variables, functions, types, object-oriented programming, all that sweet stuff. So if you don't, learn it. I'm not good at teaching that kind of thing, but there's some great resources online. I learned Python mostly thanks to SoloLearn. You can download their app on your phone, or go to [their website.](https://www.sololearn.com)

You can also learn programming right at the RobotPy docs website! I don't recommend it, but if you need to learn Python as fast as possible immediately, try [their site.](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/python.html) This does happen to be a good place to review RobotPy itself, as it *is* the official documentation for it.

There's also lots of YouTube videos teaching Python, like [this 4 hour one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) or [this 2 minute one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7X9w_GIm1s)

Whatever you choose to learn Python (or don't, if you already know it), I wish you luck! If you already know it, let's get into this!
